RSVP Smart Contract

This contract allows meetup organizers to require their guests to stake a minimum amount of Ether prior to the event.
During the event registration, the guest will provide their ETH address, where the meetup organizer can refund the ETH. If the user misses the event, the ETH will be locked up in the contract.
